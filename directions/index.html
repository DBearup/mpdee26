    <h2> Getting to Leicester </h2>
    <p> Leicester is in the heart of England with excellent communications by road, air and rail.

    <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    <p>
        The closest hotel is <a href="https://www.belmonthotel.co.uk/the-hotel/location" target="_blank">The Belmont Hotel</a> (about 10-15 minutes by walking from the conference site).

    </p>

    <h2> About the city</h2>
    <p> <a href='https://www.visitleicester.info' target='_blank'/>Leicester</a> is one of the oldest English cities with over a thousand years of history. Modern Leicester is a lively, multi-cultural city with the population of nearly 300,000. Leicester has a huge choice of pubs, clubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres as well as excellent shopping - from one of Europe's oldest markets to new shopping malls. 

Leicester is the home to the <a href='http://spacecentre.co.uk/' target='_blank'>National Space Centre</a>. It also boasts one of the largest pieces of Roman architecture in Britain (at the Jewry Wall Museum), and the largest collection of German Expressionist art in the country. One recent highlight is the burial ground & museum of <a href='https://kriii.com/' target='_blank'>King Richard III</a> that was discovered just a decade ago.
